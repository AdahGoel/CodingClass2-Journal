we learned about syntax. one time i have seen sytax is in minecraft when i try to use cheats but i do it a bit wrong. i don't know how i got it wrong but it says "unexpected syntax error" even though all i do is press a button. anyways, while learning about syntax we played simon says. (might i add that i won?) we used python to try and get the computer to print our names and me and aniika finished first. i forgot my computer so we (me and anika) woked together obn pankaj unkle's mad libs.
