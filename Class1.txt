We learned how to sort and name folders/files so that we could know what was in them instead of opening all them to figure out.
To do this, we played a game. We were split into teams that would each recive three boxes and a few items.
Then, we labled and switched boxes and were told to find the paperclip. It was not easy so we re-labed them with more specific details.
